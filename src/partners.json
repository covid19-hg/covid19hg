Many questions remain unanswered. With more than a million deaths worldwide and still growing, the pathology remains a puzzle. The widely varying clinical presentation, rates of disease progression, and outcomes, suggest multiple and complex disease causing mechanisms. Furthermore, the highest rates of infection correlate significantly with ethnicity, gender, age, and comorbidities, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 (a cell surface receptor present on many cell types), in order to gain entry into the cell, and it is widely expected host genetics is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.\nThe overarching aim of this project is to gain insights into the role of host genetics in COVID-19. We are interested in 1) GWAS and candidate gene studies; 2) exome and whole genome sequencing; 3) structural variants; 4) methylation; 5) RNA seq; 6) Omics; 7) molecular modelling and related approaches to identify relevant SNPs or other genetic variants involved in COVID-19. One of our main areas of interest includes HLA, immunity and interferon related signalling pathways.\n","studyDesign":"We will undertake bioinformatics approaches to address the key questions outlined above.

We also commit to the open sharing of any data we generate and would make this freely available to academics following a formal request and approval by ManARTS.  The outline of each arm of the work is detailed below. \n\n**_Patient Genotyping_**\nPatient genotyping will be performed using the Illumina Infinium Omni2.5-8 genotyping SNP chip or similar, and single candidate gene sequencing (e.g. _ACE2, HLA,_ _TMPRSS2_) will be performed using targeted Sanger sequencing. Genotyping approaches and pooled analysis will be coordinated with the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (<https://www.covid19hg.org/>). Initially, Genome Wide Association Studies will be performed to rapidly identify host genomic variants significantly associated with susceptibility and severity.

This data will be shared with the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (gisaid.com) for phylogenetic analysis and comparison of viral strains between patients. Variation between viral strains will be identified through appropriate techniques, e.g. variant calling through the Genome Analysis Toolkit and multi-way sequence alignments through ClustalOmega. We will identify any viral genome with one or more difference in viral strain, we will perform in-silico modelling to predict the impact of the variant, and, if appropriate, assess whether specific viral strains are enriched in patients with severe COVID-19. Where possible we will also perform metagenome sequencing from nasopharyngeal swabs to understand if coinfections exist, utilizing the SISPA protocol.\n","researchCategory":["Disease severity"],"studyDesignUnformatted":"We plan to perform paired analyses of viral genome sequences with patient genotyping techniques for patients testing positive for COVID-19. Patients admitted to hospital and testing positive for COVID-19 will be recruited to the ManARTS biobank and we propose that an EDTA blood sample is taken, allowing extraction of DNA for subsequent analysis. This will be performed in parallel with nanopore sequencing of the SARS-Cov-2 viral genome. Bringing together these two pieces of work, in collaboration with international consortia, will allow us to rapidly identify high impact genomic signals which correspond with disease severity. \n\nDNA will be extracted from EDTA samples at the MCGM and sorted in our facility as required. This process produces a large quantity of DNA and therefore we would ensure that aliquots are freely available to other academics within the ManARTS collaboration to accelerate their research. We also commit to the open sharing of any data we generate and would make this freely available to academics following a formal request and approval by ManARTS.  The outline of each arm of the work is detailed below. \n\nPatient Genotyping\nPatient genotyping will be performed using the Illumina Infinium Omni2.5-8 genotyping SNP chip or similar, and single candidate gene sequencing (e.g. ACE2, HLA, TMPRSS2) will be performed using targeted Sanger sequencing. Genotyping approaches and pooled analysis will be coordinated with the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (https://www.covid19hg.org/). Initially, Genome Wide Association Studies will be performed to rapidly identify host genomic variants significantly associated with susceptibility and severity.

Even taking into consideration the many socioeconomic factors that impact their health status, what do we know about host factors that may be partly responsible for African American and Hispanics dying in higher numbers than whites? The significance of this work relies in the potential of identifying new targets or strategies for treatment or prevention against COVID-19 disease. Having a range of the different outcomes of COVID-19 disease will also help us to identify potential targets for prevention of disease progression from asymptomatic to severe outcomes. Also, it will reveal new information about the genotypic and phenotypic host determinants in the Hispanic population associated to COVID-19 disease that could be used for future ethnicity/population studies.\n","studyDesign":"**Aim 1. To identify genetic associations with common and rare traits of COVID-19 severity in Caribbean Hispanic patients of Puerto Rico with mild and severe COVID19 disease, using Global Diversity Arrays (GDA).**We propose to identify these genetic associations of viral disease severity in a Caribbean Hispanic population due to the paucity of these studies in the Hispanic population, frequently excluded in genomic studies.

Our hypothesis is that people with severe disease have genetic variations that can affect genes that modulate disease severity. We will analyze data from identifiable participants tested for the virus in the University of Antioquia which has the centralized laboratory for COVID-19 test in for the hospitals in Medellin (and we are looking for partnerships in other cities). The study will include Global screening array genotyped testing for all participants, and a possible subset analysis of genome sequencing analysis, which will be applied to those with low risk factors and severe symptoms. Also a directed genotyping might be done in regions that are associated but come from imputation and not direct genotyping.\n","timeCreated":1606319626000,"hasSubmittedData":false,"id":"rec3k0XzGJzWvtCDE"},{"shouldShowContactButton":true,"study":"Interferon mutations in severe covid ","investigator":"Om Shrivastav ","affiliation":"Jaslok hospital and Research Centre ","country":"India","city":"Mumbai","prospective":true,"genotyping":true,"assaysPlanned":["Antibody profiling","Immune profiling"],"researchQuestion":"To evaluate  ifn antibodies and   severity of covid in Indian population \n","studyDesign":"Fifty consecutive patient's with ICU admission \nOn ventilator support\n25 males\n25 females\nexclusuion criteria  \nDiabetes mellitus\nSmokers\nHypertension \n\n","studyDesignUnformatted":"Fifty consecutive patient's with ICU admission \nOn ventilator support\n25 males\n25 females\nexclusuion criteria  \nDiabetes mellitus\nSmokers\nHypertension \n","timeCreated":1607010469000,"hasSubmittedData":false,"id":"reccBkirozpzy8Zlp"},{"shouldShowContactButton":true,"study":"Japan Coronavirus Taskforce","investigator":"Masumi Ai, Koichi Fukunaga, Naoki Hasegawa, Ho Namkoong, Seiya Imoto, Takanori Kanai, Akinori Kimura, Yuko Kitagawa, Ryuji Koike, Atsushi Kumanogoh, Satoru Miyano, Seishi Ogawa, Yukinori Okada, Toshiro Sato, Katsushi Tokunaga","affiliation":"Keio University, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Osaka University, Institute of Medical Science the University of Tokyo","country":"Japan","city":"Tokyo","studyLink":"https://www.covid19-taskforce.jp/","prospective":true,"prospectiveSampleSize":5000,"genotyping":true,"wgs":true,"assaysPlanned":["Transcriptomics","Proteomics","Metabolomics"],"researchQuestion":"Elucidation of the biological backgrounds and biomarkers responsible for COVID-19 infection outcomes is a scientific question with urgent priority.
