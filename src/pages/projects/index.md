projectsIntro: |
  This page lists projects that are supported by the COVID19 Host Genetics Initiative but they are not part of the centralized efforts because they require specialized approaches or focus on specific patients groups.

  As a reminder the centralized analysis are based on this phenotype definitions and this analysis plan.

  - title: Clonal Hematopoiesis
    description: |
      The presence of pre-existing cardiovascular and lung disease are known to be associated with severe COVID-19. Beyond medical comorbidities, age is a strong independent predictor of COVID-19 severity and may be related to age-related changes in inflammatory cells.  Clonal Hematopoiesis is known to alter the inflammatory profile of healthy individuals and may, in part, be a mediator of its ill-effects including cardiovascular disease. Age-related somatic mutations in circulating inflammatory cells have been shown to predispose to chronic inflammatory dysregulation. In some cases, these involve the same pathways implicated in COVID-19. However, whether CH predisposes to severe COVID-19 or affects the complications of COVID-19 is unknown. Conversely, inflammatory stress may be a critical driver of CH. Therefore, studying the acute effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the dynamics of CH would provide insight into the potentiators of CH. We seek to understand how clonal hematopoiesis might influence COVID-19 illness severity and conversely how acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 might promote expansion of CHIP.

  - title: COVID19 vascular complications
    description: |
      Recent publications suggest that vascular complications are common in COVID19 patients, especially complications of the ischemic / thrombotic type, and that they may be associated with unfavorable outcomes. In a series of 184 ICU patients admitted in 3 Dutch hospitals with proven COVID-19 pneumonia, 31% developed thrombotic complications, including of imaging-confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 27% and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7%.

      Two recent French studies have underlined an unexpected high number of VTE (mainly pulmonary embolism - PE) with a prevalence of 16% (64/150) in Strasbourg (3) and 21% (22/107) in Lille despite a conventional thromboprophylaxis in COVID19 patients admitted in ICU. This high increase in PE prevalence which is twice higher than the frequency of PE in the influenza ICU patients may worsen the respiratory prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The low number of associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT)in COVID-19 patients may suggest that they have pulmonary thrombosis rather than embolism. In another recent series of 221 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Union hospital, Wuhan, 5% developed acute ischemic stroke (5 large-vessel occlusion, 3 small vessel occlusion, and 3 cardioembolic strokes), 0.5% cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, 0.5% intracerebral hemorrhage.

      While in this and other series COVID19 patients with cerebrovascular complications were significantly older than those without, recent reports from New-York hospitals have described large-vessel strokes as a presenting feature in several young patients. The mechanisms underlying these vascular complications is unclear and could involve excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization and obesity (for VTE), hypercoagulability diffuse intravascular coagulation, cardio-embolism from COVID-19-related cardiac injury and arrhythmia, and possibly invasion of the central nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 leading to encephalopathy. Stroke and VTE genetic predisposition in the general population has been confirmed by recent waves of Genome Wide Association (GWAs) and genetic factors may also modulate the risk of such complications in COVID19 patients. Better understanding the mechanisms underlying the risk of vascular / thrombotic complications in COVID19 patients has important implications for prevention strategies.
      We aim to identify genetic risk factors associated with the risk of vascular complications (stroke and VTE) in COVID-19 patients, using both an agnostic approach and focusing on known genetic risk factors for these vascular diseases.
