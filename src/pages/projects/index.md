  - title: Clonal Hematopoiesis
    description: >
      The presence of pre-existing cardiovascular and lung disease are known to
      be associated with severe COVID-19. Beyond medical comorbidities, age is a
      strong independent predictor of COVID-19 severity and may be related to
      age-related changes in inflammatory cells.  Clonal Hematopoiesis is known
      to alter the inflammatory profile of healthy individuals and may, in part,
      be a mediator of its ill-effects including cardiovascular disease.
      Age-related somatic mutations in circulating inflammatory cells have been
      shown to predispose to chronic inflammatory dysregulation. In some cases,
      these involve the same pathways implicated in COVID-19. However, whether
      CH predisposes to severe COVID-19 or affects the complications of COVID-19
      is unknown. Conversely, inflammatory stress may be a critical driver of
      CH. Therefore, studying the acute effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the
      dynamics of CH would provide insight into the potentiators of CH. We seek
      to understand how clonal hematopoiesis might influence COVID-19 illness
      severity and conversely how acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 might promote
      expansion of CHIP.

  - title: COVID19 vascular complications
    description: >
      Recent publications suggest that vascular complications are common in
      COVID19 patients, especially complications of the ischemic / thrombotic
      type, and that they may be associated with unfavorable outcomes. In a
      series of 184 ICU patients admitted in 3 Dutch hospitals with proven
      COVID-19 pneumonia, 31% developed thrombotic complications, including of
      imaging-confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 27% and arterial
      thrombotic events in 3.7%.


      Two recent French studies have underlined an unexpected high number of VTE
      (mainly pulmonary embolism - PE) with a prevalence of 16% (64/150) in
      Strasbourg (3) and 21% (22/107) in Lille despite a conventional
      thromboprophylaxis in COVID19 patients admitted in ICU. This high increase
      in PE prevalence which is twice higher than the frequency of PE in the
      influenza ICU patients may worsen the respiratory prognosis of COVID-19
      patients. The low number of associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT)in
      COVID-19 patients may suggest that they have pulmonary thrombosis rather
      than embolism. In another recent series of 221 patients with COVID-19
      hospitalized in Union hospital, Wuhan, 5% developed acute ischemic stroke
      (5 large-vessel occlusion, 3 small vessel occlusion, and 3 cardioembolic
      strokes), 0.5% cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, 0.5% intracerebral
      hemorrhage.


      While in this and other series COVID19 patients with cerebrovascular
      complications were significantly older than those without, recent reports
      from New-York hospitals have described large-vessel strokes as a
      presenting feature in several young patients. The mechanisms underlying
      these vascular complications is unclear and could involve excessive
      inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization and obesity (for VTE),
      hypercoagulability diffuse intravascular coagulation, cardio-embolism from
      COVID-19-related cardiac injury and arrhythmia, and possibly invasion of
      the central nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 leading to encephalopathy. Stroke
      and VTE genetic predisposition in the general population has been
      confirmed by recent waves of Genome Wide Association (GWAs) and genetic
      factors may also modulate the risk of such complications in COVID19
      patients. Better understanding the mechanisms underlying the risk of
      vascular / thrombotic complications in COVID19 patients has important
      implications for prevention strategies.

      We aim to identify genetic risk factors associated with the risk of
      vascular complications (stroke and VTE) in COVID-19 patients, using both
      an agnostic approach and focusing on known genetic risk factors for these
      vascular diseases.

  - title: Acute respiratory distress syndrome
    description: >-
      The most severe outcome among COVID-19 cases includes acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and related respiratory failure that may fall
      outside of the Berlin definition of ARDS (i.e., ARDS-like respiratory
      illness) but could still share underlying genetic risk factors.
      Additionally, while many groups are waiting for genotype data on
      SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals to be generated, it would be prudent to
      examine existing data on ARDS (and ARDS-like respiratory illness) in the
      context of other non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses and in the context of
      sepsis.


      The primary research question includes: Which host genetic susceptibility
      factors are associated with ARDS or ARDS-like phenotypes in the context of
      respiratory viruses OR sepsis?


      Discovery of these variants will then enable further comparisons with
      other consortium or investigator-led analyses. For example: Which host
      genetic susceptibility factors for COVID-19 ARDS are unique to SARS-CoV-2
      infection and which ones are shared with ARDS subsequent to other
      respiratory viruses OR sepsis?
