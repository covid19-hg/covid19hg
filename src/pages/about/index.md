## Why?

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia has spread rapidly across the world. While the majority of individuals presents mild symptoms, a subgroup of critically ill patients is admitted to intensive care units and requires mechanical ventilation. The proportion of critically ill patients varies across countries and depends on the specific type of screening strategy enforced in the population.

Patients admitted to intensive care units tend to be older and being diagnosed with previous comorbid conditions. But this does not fully explain differences in disease severity between individuals.

We think that genetic susceptibility can play a role in explaining differences in individual disease susceptibility, severity and prognosis.

## The goal

*The idea is simple*: can we create a community behind studying the genetics of people that have been infected with COVID-19?

## How does it work?

1) You send us consented DNA samples together with some basic clinical information

2) We genotype the sample for free (GSA global screening array)

3) Every 1000 samples, we will run whole-genome and HLA-specific imputations and make the genetic and curated clinical data available to the scientific community

## Which clinical information should I collect ?

*The more, the merrier*

However, this is the suggested set of information:

* Age
* Sex
* Body Mass Index
* Smoking information (past, current, never) and number of cigarettes/day
* Comorbidities; Diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, renal insufficiency, COPD, Malignant tumor, autoimmune diseases
* Pneumonia: non-present, present: unilateral, present: bilateral (dual)
* Any relevant severity score: E.g. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), quick sepsis related organ failure assessment (qSOFA)
* If patient is currently in intensive care. Therapy: oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), intubation

Other information that are relevant: Hematologic malignancy, organ transplant, immunodeficiency, asthma, cystic fibrosis, Charlson comorbity index, MI, CHF, PVD, CVA, Dementia, COPD, CT, PUD, Liver disease, DM, Hemiplegia, CKD, Leukemia, Lymphoma, AIDS, Days with symptoms, antiviral at diagnosis, mortality, clinical laboratory, radiological data.

## Which consent do I need?

Patient consent should allow for genetic and clinical data to be shared with the broader scientific community upon approval of the study coordinator. We can share the consent forms used across studies.
