title: A collaborative effort

## Why?

The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis creating severe disruptions across the economy and health system. Insights into how better understand and treat COVID-19 are desperately needed. Given the importance and urgency in obtaining these insights, it is critical for the scientific community to come together around this shared purpose.

The COVID-19 host genetics initiative brings together the human genetics community to generate, share and analyze data to learn the genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and outcomes. Such discoveries could help to generate hypotheses for drug repurposing, identify individuals at unusually high or low risk, and contribute to global knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.

## The goal

The COVID-19 host genetics initiative is a bottom-up collaborative effort that has three main aims:

1. Provide an environment to foster the sharing of resources to facilitate COVID-19 host genetics research (e.g. protocols, questionnaires).
2. Organize analytical activities across studies to identify genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.
3. Provide a platform to share the results from such activities, as well as the individual-level data where possible, to benefit the broader scientific community.

## Which studies can partecipate?



*Retrospective studies/existing biobanks*

From biobanks with existing significant genetic data and active connections to health systems, there is an opportunity to opportunistically and rapidly develop a genetic study on susceptibility and severity. For example, in Finland with the national network of biobanks covering each hospital district, it is possible to acquire almost 'real-time' updates on COVID-19 status of individuals already in FinnGen. For this group of studies we will use the structure that has already been put in place by the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative:[https://www.globalbiobankmeta.org](https://www.globalbiobankmeta.org/)



*Prospective studies*

Understanding that the opportunistic approach above will be limited in numbers in most locations, in parallel many have started directly consenting with a new protocol incoming COVID-19 patients in order to build the numbers more rapidly. In some cases, this may take place in the context of a biobank consent, in some places this will require a specific new study. More than just the critical jump in scale for studying progression, severity and outcomes, these studies bring important additional opportunities not only for deeper DNA studies, but potentially informative viral and antibody profiling and epitope mapping experiments which should be defined and implemented in many sites with relatively small blood/plasma requirements.

For this group of studies, The COVID-19 host genetics initiative can provide support with protocols and questionnaires. We strongly encourage these new studies to include in the informed consent a sentence to inform the participants that data will be shared with other scientists to advance COVID-19 research.

Every group is free to choose a study design that suits the study-specific research question and to pursue different approaches for genotyping/sequencing. FIMM provides free genotypes on GSA Illumina array. Other countries offer similar services (e.g. SciLifeLab in Sweden).

We expect that many of the studies will pull individual-level genetic and clinical data together to advance analysis beyond simple GWAS, but also to allow other researchers outside the initiative to use the data.

## Which clinical information should I collect ?

*The more, the merrier*

However, this is the suggested set of information:

* Age
* Sex
* Body Mass Index
* Smoking information (past, current, never) and number of cigarettes/day
* Comorbidities; Diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, renal insufficiency, COPD, Malignant tumor, autoimmune diseases
* Pneumonia: non-present, present: unilateral, present: bilateral (dual)
* Any relevant severity score: E.g. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), quick sepsis related organ failure assessment (qSOFA)
* If patient is currently in intensive care. Therapy: oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), intubation

Other information that are relevant: Hematologic malignancy, organ transplant, immunodeficiency, asthma, cystic fibrosis, Charlson comorbity index, MI, CHF, PVD, CVA, Dementia, COPD, CT, PUD, Liver disease, DM, Hemiplegia, CKD, Leukemia, Lymphoma, AIDS, Days with symptoms, antiviral at diagnosis, mortality, clinical laboratory, radiological data.



## What is the analytical strategy ?

The overall idea is to first run a quick and simple analysis to detect any large genetic effects of severe COVID-19 (e.g., HLA). Second, we will focus on a much more comprehensive analysis with more phenotyping. This might include analyses using exome or genome sequencing, RNA sequencing or immunological assays.
