publications_page_intro: Many of the participating groups in COVID-19 Host
  Genetics Initiative have already submitted or published genetic findings
  during or in advance of.  These findings should be cited as relevant to
  follow-up work based on specific discovered loci, even if that work may have
  been based on unpublished analyses of the HGI.
