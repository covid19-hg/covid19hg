  title: Mission
  description: >-
    The COVID-19 host genetics initiative brings together the human genetics
    community to generate, share and analyze data to learn the genetic
    determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and outcomes. Such
    discoveries could help to generate hypotheses for drug repurposing, identify
    individuals at unusually high or low risk, and contribute to global
    knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.

  The COVID-19 host genetics initiative is a bottom-up collaborative effort that
  has three main aims:

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
