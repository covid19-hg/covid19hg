  title: Mission
  description: ' The COVID-19 host genetics initiative aims to provide support and an analytical network for studies that are broadly interested in identifying genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.  Such discoveries could help to generate hypotheses for drug repurposing, identify individuals at unusually high or low risk, and contribute to global knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.'

  The COVID-19 host genetics initiative is a bottom-up collaborative effort that
  has three main aims:

        Aim 1: Provide an environment where researchers interested in COVID-19
        host genetics can interact with each other and share resources (e.g.
        protocols, questionnaires).

        Aim 2: Organize analytical activities across studies to identify genetic
        determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

        Aim 3: Provide a platform to share the results from such activities, as
        well as the individual-level data where possible, to benefit the broader
        scientific community
  heading: What we offer
  description: >
    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
