  title: Mission
  description: >
    Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia has
    spread rapidly across the world. We can use genetic analysis to identify
    differences in individual disease susceptibility, severity and prognosis.
description: >-
  While the majority of individuals presents mild symptoms, a subgroup of
  critically ill patients is admitted to intensive care units and requires
  mechanical ventilation. The proportion of critically ill patients varies
  across countries and depends on the specific type of screening strategy
  enforced in the population.  Patients admitted to intensive care units tend to
  be older and being diagnosed with previous comorbid conditions. But this does
  not fully explain differences in disease severity between individuals.  We
  think that genetic susceptibility can play a role in explaining differences in
  individual disease susceptibility, severity and prognosis.

        Phase 1: Planning and collaboration. In the coming days and 
        weeks, we hope to join forces with as
        many research partners as possible. The covid19hg initiative is
        currently comprised of over thirty partners including biobanks,
        universities, research institutes, and industry partners.
        The more partners that join, the more powerful our 
        meta-analyses becomes. 
        Here is the full list of partners. link to
        partners page. Click here to contact us for more information 
        about joining.

        Phase 2: Retrospective analysis: existing epidemiological cohorts
        contain rich collections of genetic and phenotopic data for select
        individuals. We will identify indivduals in these cohorts that have 
        been diagnosed with COVID-19 and carry out association analyses to
        derive immediate insight. These data will provide rapid 
        proof-of-concept results.

        Phase 3: Prospective analysis. Our partners will send us samples 
        from patients infected by COVID-19 who are not already present on 
        our existing cohorts. We will carry out genotyping and 
        association analysis and combine these sample with our
        retrospective samples. In the coming weeks, we expect to 
        receive thousands of samples from Italy.

        Phase 4. Ongoing distribution of results: meta-analysis will 
        continue as more partners and samples are added. Summary statistics 
        will be shared and continuously updated on this website 
        without restriction. Our results could help identify susceptible
        populations and lead to development of new therapeutics.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
