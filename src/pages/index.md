  title: Mission
  description: >
    Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia has
    spread rapidly across the world. We can use genetic analysis to identify
    differences in individual disease susceptibility, severity and prognosis.
description: >-
  While the majority of individuals presents mild symptoms, a subgroup of
  critically ill patients is admitted to intensive care units and requires
  mechanical ventilation. The proportion of critically ill patients varies
  across countries and depends on the specific type of screening strategy
  enforced in the population.  Patients admitted to intensive care units tend to
  be older and being diagnosed with previous comorbid conditions. But this does
  not fully explain differences in disease severity between individuals.  We
  think that genetic susceptibility can play a role in explaining differences in
  individual disease susceptibility, severity and prognosis.

        Objective 1: Collaboration. In the coming days and  weeks, we
        hope to join forces with as many research partners as possible. The
        covid19hg initiative is currently comprised of over thirty partners
        including biobanks, universities, research institutes, and industry
        partners. The more partners that join, the more powerful our 
        meta-analyses becomes.  Here is the full list of partners. link to
        partners page. Click here to contact us for more information  about
        joining.

        Objective 2: Retrospective study. existing epidemiological cohorts
        contain rich collections of genetic and phenotopic data for select
        individuals. We will identify indivduals in these cohorts that have 
        been diagnosed with COVID-19 and carry out association analyses to
        derive immediate insight. These data will provide rapid 
        proof-of-concept results.

        Objective 3: Prospective study. Our partners will send us samples  from
        patients infected by COVID-19 who are not already present on  our
        existing cohorts. We will carry out genotyping and  association analysis
        and combine these sample with our retrospective samples. In the coming
        weeks, we expect to  receive thousands of samples from Italy.

        Objective 4: Data sharing. Summary statistics  will be 
        continuously updated on this website for the research community
        to use without restriction. As more partners and samples 
        are added, our meta-analysis gains power to identify useful
        signal.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
