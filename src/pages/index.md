  title: Why?
  description: >
    Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia has
    spread rapidly across the world. We can use genetic analysis to identify
    differences in individual disease susceptibility, severity and prognosis.
description: >-
  While the majority of individuals presents mild symptoms, a subgroup of
  critically ill patients is admitted to intensive care units and requires
  mechanical ventilation. The proportion of critically ill patients varies
  across countries and depends on the specific type of screening strategy
  enforced in the population.  Patients admitted to intensive care units tend to
  be older and being diagnosed with previous comorbid conditions. But this does
  not fully explain differences in disease severity between individuals.  We
  think that genetic susceptibility can play a role in explaining differences in
  individual disease susceptibility, severity and prognosis.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
