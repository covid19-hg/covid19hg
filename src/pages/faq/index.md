  - question: '**How can I submit my data?**'
    answer: >-
      You can submit data in two ways. You can submit *results summary
      statistics* (calculated and formatted according to the analysis plan) or
      you can submit *individual-level data*.


      We prefer you submit individual-level data because they can be used beyond
      the few analyses that are described in the analysis plan.


      **\

      Results summary statistics**


      Information on how to upload results summary statistics are given in the
      analysis plan in the section “Results upload instructions”


      **Individual-level data**


      You can submit individual-level data (i.e. genetic and clinical phenotype
      data) via the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). EGA offers services
      for archiving, processing and distribution for all types of potentially
      identifiable genetic and phenotypic human data at the European
      Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). To start your submission please contact
      the EGA helpdesk
      via[helpdesk@ega-archive.org](mailto:helpdesk@ega-archive.org)and mark the
      email F.A.O Giselle Kerry stating that your submission is part of the
      COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative.
  - question: '**Who will have access to the individual-level data?**'
    answer: >-
      Researchers can have access to individual-level data in two
      ways.Researchers within the initiative(i.e. researchers that are
      registered to the initiative and that have also deposited data) and
      researchers outside the initiative.


      [Researchers outside the initiative](https://www.covid19hg.org/about/)


      Access to individual-level data/datasets by external researchers is
      controlled by a Data Access Committee (DAC), which must be registered as
      part of the submission process. A DAC may consist of a single or several
      committee member/s that are responsible for making data access decisions
      in response to applications made by individuals wishing to access data. A
      DAC may be responsible for approving access to single or multiple
      datasets.Only those who have successfully applied for access via the DAC
      will receive access to the dataset(s) archived at the EGA.


      Researchers within the initiative


      Researchers within the initiative that have deposited data or results
      summary statistics or are part of established analysis groups will have
      fast-track access to the initiative's data deposited on EGA. The Data
      Access Committee (DAC), which is composed by the PIs of the studies that
      have deposited the data, will facilitate access to the full data pool. We
      are currently discussing which procedures to implement to facilitate fast
      access to these groups of researchers. All researchers are required to
      follow the code of conduct outlined
      in[https://www.covid19hg.org/about/.](https://www.covid19hg.org/about/)
  - question: |
      Who will have access to the results summary statistics?
    answer: >-
      Results summary statistics will be meta-analyzed across studies and
      immediately made available to the scientific community via the website
      result browser, via [GWAS catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/), [Open
      Target Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/) and other portals.
  - question: |
      My data cannot leave my country, what can I do?
    answer: >-
      EGA is working with partners to establish federated nodes, however, these
      are still in development at this time.
  - question: >
      Is the system compliant with current European regulations for data
      protection?
    answer: (TBD)
  - question: |
      In which format should I submit the genetic data?
    answer: >-
      The EGA accepts data the following formats


      ![](/img/ega-accedpted-data-types.png)


      All manufacturer-specific raw data formats for the major next [generation
      sequencing platforms](https://ega-archive.org/ega/submission/sequence) are
      accepted, including aligned BAM files and variation files in VCF format.


      All array-based technologies are accepted, which may include the raw data,
      intensity and analysis files, and there are no restrictions on data
      formats accepted.
  - question: |
      In which format should I submit the clinical/phenotype data ?
    answer: >-

  - question: |
      I’m still collecting samples, can I upload my data in batches?
    answer: >-
      Yes, this is entirely possible. We suggest creating a dataset to submit
      every 500 samples.
  - question: |
      I’m a US, NIH-funded study, can I submit the data?
    answer: Yes.
