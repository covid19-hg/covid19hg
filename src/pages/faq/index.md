  - question: How can I submit my data?
    answer: >+
      You can submit data in two ways. You can submit results summary statistics
      (calculated and formatted according to the analysis plan) or you can
      submit individual-level data.

      We prefer you submit individual-level data because they can be used beyond
      the few analyses that are described in the analysis plan.


      ## Results summary statistics

      Information on how to upload results summary statistics are given in the
      analysis plan in the section “Results upload instructions”


      ## Individual-level data

      You can submit individual-level data (i.e. genetic and clinical data) via
      the The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). EGA offers services for
      archiving, processing and distribution for all types of potentially
      identifiable genetic and phenotypic human data at the European
      Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). To start your submission please contact
      the EGA helpdesk via helpdesk@ega-archive.org and mark the email F.A.O
      Giselle Kerry stating that your submission is part of the COVID-19 Host
      Genetics Initiative.

  - question: Who will have access to the individual-level data?
    answer: >+
      Researchers can have access to individual-level data in two ways.
      *Researchers within the initiative* (i.e. researchers that are registered
      to the initiative and that have also deposited data) and *researchers
      outside the initiative*.


      ## Researchers within the initiative


      Researchers within the initiative that have deposited data or results
      summary statistics will have direct access to the data deposited by other
      groups on EGA as part of the initiative. Researchers that have not
      uploaded any data, but are part of the initiative will have access to the
      shared individual-level data if they are part of an analysis group or
      other groups with a clear analysis plan. All researchers are required to
      follow the code of conduct outlined in https://www.covid19hg.org/about/.


      ## Researchers outside the initiative


      Access to individual-level data/datasets by external researchers is
      controlled by a Data Access Committee (DAC), which must be registered as
      part of the submission process. A DAC may consist of a single or several
      committee member/s that are responsible for making data access decisions
      in response to applications made by individuals wishing to access data.  A
      DAC may be responsible for approving access to single or multiple
      datasets.  Only those who have successfully applied for access via the DAC
      will receive access to the dataset(s) archived at the EGA.

  - question: |
      In which format should I submit the genetic data?
    answer: >-
      The EGA accepts data the following formats


      ![](/img/ega-accedpted-data-types.png)


      All manufacturer-specific raw data formats for the major next [generation
      sequencing platforms](https://ega-archive.org/ega/submission/sequence) are
      accepted, including aligned BAM files and variation files in VCF format.


      All array-based technologies are accepted, which may include the raw data,
      intensity and analysis files, and there are no restrictions on data
      formats accepted.
