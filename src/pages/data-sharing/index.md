  - question: '## **How can I submit my data?**'
    answer: >-
      You can submit data in two ways. You can submit *results summary
      statistics* (calculated and formatted according to the [analysis
      plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pcq1jttF8W7ifEUXA6-a1WVMsUyEoAybS6IqvuP-Uv8/edit?usp=sharing))
      or you can submit *individual-level data*.


      We prefer you submit individual-level data because they can be used beyond
      the few analyses that are described in the [analysis
      plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pcq1jttF8W7ifEUXA6-a1WVMsUyEoAybS6IqvuP-Uv8/edit?usp=sharing).


      **Results summary statistics**


      Information on how to upload results summary statistics are given in the
      [analysis
      plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pcq1jttF8W7ifEUXA6-a1WVMsUyEoAybS6IqvuP-Uv8/edit?usp=sharing)
      in the section “Results upload instructions”


      **Individual-level data**


      If you are not from US:


      * You can submit individual-level data (i.e. genetic and clinical
      phenotype data) via the [European Genome-phenome
      Archive](https://ega-archive.org/) (EGA). EGA offers services for
      archiving, processing and distribution for all types of potentially
      identifiable genetic and phenotypic human data at the European
      Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). To start your submission please fill this
      [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjJLpqf119XfpvpV7KBqVXyF9ywQ_4NruSzwC-gtV17nTxwg/viewform)
      or contact the EGA helpdesk via
      [helpdesk@ega-archive.org](mailto:helpdesk@ega-archive.org) and mark the
      email F.A.O Giselle Kerry stating that your submission is part of the
      COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative.


      If you are from the US:


      * You can submit individual-level data via [NHGRI
      AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org/). The AnVIL can ingest datasets, process
      them via standardized pipelines and perform quality control on them, and
      make them accessible to other researchers in a cloud-based environment. To
      start your submission, please contact
      [COVID@lists.anvilproject.org](mailto:COVID@lists.anvilproject.org) and
      mark the email Attn: COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative.
  - question: '## **Who will have access to the individual-level data?**'
    answer: >-
      All researchers can apply for access to the initiative's data deposited on
      EGA and AnVIL via their respective DAC. For data at the EGA, the DAC is
      composed by the PIs of the studies that have deposited the data, and will
      facilitate access to the full data pool. For data on the AnVIL, a HGI
      specific DAC composed of members of the HGI will manage data access via
      [DUOS](https://duos.broadinstitute.org/). 


      All researchers are required to follow the code of conduct outlined in
      [https://www.covid19hg.org/​about/.](https://www.covid19hg.org/about/)
  - question: '## **Who will have access to the results summary statistics?**'
    answer: >-
      Results summary statistics will be meta-analyzed across studies and
      immediately made available to the scientific community via the website
      result browser, via [GWAS catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/), [Open
      Target Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/) and other portals.
  - question: '## **Can I access summary statistics from the individual studies?**'
    answer: >-
      On the [result page](https://www.covid19hg.org/results/), we make
      available the meta-analysis summary statistics for the combined studies
      with and without UK Biobank. However, to access the study-specific summary
      statistics you will need to get in contact with each study PI separately.
  - question: '## **My data cannot leave my country, what can I do?**'
    answer: >-
      The EGA is working with the ELIXIR network to establish the EGA Federation
      network to enable data to be deposited within national jurisdictions. We
      expect to launch the first nodes in mid-late 2020. In the meantime, we
      suggest you contact your country's ELIXIR head of node to find out about
      the current status for your country.
  - question: '## **In which format should I submit the genetic data?**'
    answer: >-
      Both EGA and AnVIL recommend using open standards and formats that are
      maintained by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH),
      published in the GA4GH [Genomic Data
      Toolkit](https://www.ga4gh.org/genomic-data-toolkit/). For genome
      sequencing data this includes FASTQ, BAM, CRAM, and VCF. All array-based
      technologies are accepted, which may include the raw data, intensity and
      analysis files, and there are no restrictions on data formats accepted.
  - question: >-
      ## **Is the system compliant with current European regulations for data
      protection?**
    answer: >-
      The EGA is managed by EMBL-EBI and Center for Genome Regulation, Barcelona
      (CRG). At EMBL, that protection is enacted by the Internal Policy 68 on
      general data protection ([IP
      68](https://www.embl.de/aboutus/administration/legal-services/data-protection/IP68-Data-Protection-EN-18052018.pdf)).
      IP 68 resembles the GDPR, but adapts to the intergovernmental nature of
      EMBL and to the needs of enabling free scientific research across national
      borders. CRG is subject to the GDPR and implements it fully. The EGA GDPR
      notices can be found [here](https://ega-archive.org/gdpr-notice).
  - question: '## **In which format should I submit the clinical/phenotype data ?**'
    answer: >-
      Clinical data should be included as part of the study submission. We
      suggest formatting the data following the initiative’s [data
      dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RXrJIzHKkyB8qx5tHLQjcBioiDAOrQ3odAuqMS3pUUI/edit?usp=sharing)
      (tab *FREEZE_1*). Not all the variables listed in the data dictionary are
      required. If you want to submit variables that are not listed in the data
      dictionary please contact
      [stefano.ceri@polimi.it](mailto:stefano.ceri@polimi.it)
  - question: '## **I’m still collecting samples, can I upload my data in batches?**'
    answer: >-
      Yes, this is entirely possible. We suggest creating a dataset to submit
      every 500 samples
