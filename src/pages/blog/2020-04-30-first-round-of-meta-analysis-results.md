We have released the first round of meta-analysis results [here](https://drive.google.com/a/broadinstitute.org/file/d/1opblju_520DZnZMGJtLTF8iNOGtwMBZp/view?usp=sharing).

We want to thank the participating studies:

\- UK Biobank (analyzed by Danny Wilson, Konrad Karczewski, Tomoko Nakanishi and Manuel Rivas)

\- Finngen (analyzed by Juha Karjalainen)

\- Genes and Health (analyzed by David Van Heel)

\- Lifelines (analyzed by Patrick Deelen)

\- BioMe biobank (analyzed by Arden Moscati)

Although we donâ€™t pose any restriction on the use of these summary statistics **we recommend to wait for future and more stable releases for use in publications not only because the current sample size is small, but also because the phenotype definition - acquired in these first studies from conveniently available existing biobanks - does not optimally capture either severity or susceptibility**. Hence this should be thought of as a demonstration run to get the consortium moving
