Updated results and summary statistic downloads are now available from the (still small but growing!) COVID-19 GWAS meta-analysis. Analyses this time include severity, susceptibility and COVID-19 associated symptoms.

Results are downloadable at <https://www.covid19hg.org/results/r2/>

As a reminder, these results are based on [phenotype definition V1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eMdzhO5xk-MACxjz-kOUJLP6Jort5KuwoOa_u-aZPHs/edit?usp=sharing) and [analysis plan V1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pcq1jttF8W7ifEUXA6-a1WVMsUyEoAybS6IqvuP-Uv8/edit?usp=sharing)[](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pcq1jttF8W7ifEUXA6-a1WVMsUyEoAybS6IqvuP-Uv8/edit?usp=sharing)

Thanks to early contributing sites and analysts listed with the results representing UK Biobank, Finngen, Genes and Health, Lifelines, BioMe biobank, Helix, Netherlands Twin Registry, Mass General Brigham Biobank.

**We will aim to update analyses when significant numbers of new samples are contributed and invite and encourage groups with more than 100 genotyped/sequenced COVID-19 cases to reach out**. Together we will continue to make these results freely available to the community as quickly as possible.
