On Friday, 27th of March we had the first call for data contributors. We have > 180 participants and very useful discussion. We are working on establishing a "matchmaking" area, where different study can connect to each other according to their research questions. We are also working on defining a set of core phenotypes to bring forward to discussion and analysis.

We have established a new registration form: <https://www.covid19hg.com/register/> where study can register. We will make the results of this registration available on the website.
